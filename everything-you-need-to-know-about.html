<h3><strong><em>A Closer Look at Foster Care</em></strong></h3>

<p>This section provides the information you need to become a foster parent, including considerations, requirements, and the licensing and approval process.</p>

<p>Are you prepared to take on the role of a foster parent? Join over<a href="https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2/who-cares-2020-executive-summary/49243#:~:text=There%20were%20218%2C927%20licensed%20foster,a%20decline%20of%20approximately%202%25." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> 200,000 foster homes</a> offering safety and a loving, stable home for foster children.</p>

<p>While that number may sound big, it falls significantly short of the need. There are nearly 400,000 children who need foster homes in the United States. Simply stated, not enough people are willing to be foster parents to meet the high demand for foster homes. Foster children and youth of all ages need foster parents, and the need for good home care is greatest among teenagers.</p>

<p>Foster parenting is a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but like any other parenting, it can be a real challenge. If your heart and home are open to fostering a child, we can help you.</p>

<h3>What are the Six Types of Foster Care?</h3>

<p>There are six distinct forms of foster care. Each serves a purpose in the health and human services system. Every one of them desperately needs more foster parents.</p>

<h3>1 - Traditional Foster Care</h3>

<p>When most people think of "foster care," they are thinking of traditional foster care. Licensed foster families who offer traditional foster care bring foster children into their homes for short- or long-term placement.</p>

<p>Foster kids need care for different periods of time. Most foster case plans aim to reunite foster kids with their birth families or primary caregivers. In foster care, social workers call this reunification.</p>

<p>Many adults in traditional foster care are "career" or "mission-driven" foster parents. They may also simply be exploring how foster care works for them. Still others are hoping to <a href="https://www.fosteruskids.org/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-to-be-a-foster-parent#foster_to_adopt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foster-to-adopt</a>. When children are unable to return home, they may become eligible for adoption.</p>

<h3>2 - Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC)</h3>

<p>Therapeutic Foster Care&nbsp;is a high-level support program for coordinating social support services for foster kids in care. It tends to be short-term, intensive care provided by foster parents who have received specialized child support training. Foster parents who have this range of training are few in number. Their training includes behavior- to trauma-informed approaches geared toward elevated support for the tier of foster youth who need TFC.</p>

<h3>3 - Respite Care</h3>

<p>By definition, "respite" is a short break for rest and renewal. Foster respite care aptly gets its name for parents and/or children who need a break in their foster care. Respite care often comes into play if foster parents need time away, such as for travel outside their state. Foster parents can also use it if they need a break from a challenging time with their foster child.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4 - Kinship Care</h3>

<p>The first goal of social workers in foster care is to place a child with close relatives. Biological family members could mean an aunt, uncle, grandmother, grandfather, or even a close family friend.</p>

<p>Kinship care refers to the placement of a foster child within their biological family or a close family friend. Most child protection groups prioritize finding a relative to care for a child before considering other foster care options. The goal is to keep children connected to their biological family and broader community whenever possible.</p>

<h3>5 - Emergency Foster Care</h3>

<p>Emergency foster care is typically shorter in length compared to other foster care alternatives. Social workers make emergency placements when displaced children urgently and immediately need a place to stay. Foster homes that handle these emergency placements are prepared to take in foster children at a moment's notice.</p>

<h3>6 - Fostering to Adopt&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The most common form of foster parenting is among families hoping to adopt foster kids into their forever families. Many adults become foster parents already thinking about fostering to adopt. While social services prefer to rejoin foster kids with their biological families or primary caregivers, this is not always possible. In cases where foster children cannot return home, their foster families often adopt them through the foster-to-adopt process.</p>

<p>Adopted foster children have better outcomes in life when they join a family before leaving foster care and becoming independent adults.</p>

<h3>Requirements to Become a Foster Parent</h3>

<p>Being a foster parent doesn't require you to fit any particular profile. Foster parents can be from any life background, educational level, or age group. There is no such thing as a perfect parent, and there is no such requirement to be a perfect foster parent.</p>

<p>Individuals who choose to offer foster kids a secure, caring environment essentially need only to have ample time and unwavering support. Eligibility and preparation requirements vary from state to state; however, most have similar foundations.</p>

<p>To check the specific requirements to be a foster parent in your state, use this <a href="https://www.fosteruskids.org/usa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state-by-state guide</a>. Common minimum requirements include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>
	<li>Attend foster parent orientation</li>
	<li>Finish pre-service training sessions</li>
	<li>Participate in face-to-face interviews</li>
	<li>Pass a home safety inspection</li>
	<li>Clear a criminal background check</li>
	<li>Have a valid driver's license and vehicle insurance</li>
	<li>Provide medical proof of health sufficient to care for foster children</li>
	<li>Show sufficient income and/or financial stability</li>
	<li>Give personal references</li>
	<li>Complete the Home Study process</li>
</ul>

<p>Many child-placing agencies have their own rules above minimum age or other requirements. Your l<a href="https://www.fosteruskids.org/usa/all/agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ocal child-placing agency</a> can walk you through the details.</p>

<h3>Foster Care Application Process</h3>

<p>While there are many requirements, each is in place to ensure foster children receive adequate care. These requirements also provide prospective foster parents with guidelines to decide whether fostering is the best course for their families. Guidelines also help aspiring foster parents prepare for the process.</p>

<p>The first step in the fostering approval process is foster parent orientation. On average, completing the process and becoming a licensed foster family takes three to six months. While lengthy, social services want to ensure children will be safe and well-cared in their foster homes.</p>

<p>The application process includes foster training sessions. Called "pre-service training," these sessions prepare soon-to-be foster parents to support the foster children they take in. Basic topics covered in early training include how to navigate the rest of the application process. More advanced topics include managing issues commonly experienced by foster kids and being a nurturing foster parent.</p>

<h3>What is a Home Study?</h3>

<p>Part of the foster care application process involves a child advocate from social services&nbsp;visiting your home. During multiple home visits, your caseworker will conduct interviews with family members and complete a home inspection. This thorough process ensures interested adults and their homes are fit and ready to foster and care for children.</p>

<p>The home inspection covers basic safety and health issues, such as having clean restrooms and kitchens. Trained foster child advocates also check the home for fire or other safety hazards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Social services require each foster child to have their own bed. If you foster siblings, most states mandate two bedrooms, including one for boys and one for girls.</p>

<h3>How to Prepare for Foster Child Placement</h3>

<p>When becoming a foster parent, the first thing to do is prepare for the child's arrival. Families must prepare the home and assemble supplies the foster child may need.</p>

<p>Many children enter foster care with few or no personal belongings. They may have come from a difficult situation and may not ask for help or mention their needs. Foster parents need to show their care and ensure foster children feel safe and secure. A little preparation and tender loving care go a long way to making a scared child feel comfortable.</p>

<p>Foster children typically need clothing, blankets, bedding, and personal hygiene items. Many kids need basic items, like a toothbrush, a hot bath or shower, and grooming supplies. They also need age-appropriate toys, food, and drinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Caring for Foster Children</h3>

<p>Adults who provide foster care take on the role of parent to the children in care. It is a big commitment to provide nurturing care to a foster child. Getting used to this new role takes time.</p>

<p>Being a foster parent is not the same for everyone, but there are important things every foster parent should learn.</p>

<h3>Fostering Kids Across Age Groups</h3>

<p>Fostering an infant takes different skills than fostering an older child or teenager. Infants need around-the-clock care and attention. Infant care responsibility includes changing diapers, feeding, and bathing the baby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Older children may be more self-sufficient, but this is not always true. Some older kids occasionally grapple with social and behavioral challenges stemming from previous trauma and mistreatment. While their needs differ from those of an infant, they may still have a number of individual needs.</p>

<p>The most underserved foster group in need is teenagers, especially those about to "age out" of foster care. People often regard teens as the most difficult to foster. Like parenting all teenagers, adolescents in foster care display classic teen attitudes and sometimes behavioral or social issues.&nbsp;They can also be among the most rewarding foster parent-child relationships.</p>

<p>Foster parents who wish to care for a particular age group can make this request in the foster application. Foster child advocates strive to make the closest possible match between foster child and foster family needs.</p>

<p>Not all adults have the parenting disposition to handle kids from every age bracket. Some do well with teenagers and struggle with infants; some thrive in infant care but struggle to connect with teens.</p>

<h3>Fostering Siblings</h3>

<p>Keeping a family together is essential for the safety of a child and their brothers and sisters. Entering foster care is traumatic, and facing separation from siblings can be devastating for children in flux.</p>

<p>Foster care agencies work with the Department of Social Services to keep siblings together whenever possible. Sometimes, they can find a foster family with a big enough home for a group of siblings. There is a massive shortage of families to care for siblings entering foster care, especially those in Treatment Foster Care (TFC).</p>

<p>All local Departments of Social Services prioritize keeping siblings together. Local social services departments seek&nbsp;kinship care&nbsp;first with the help of social workers to locate children's next of kin. Social workers aim to keep siblings together in foster care if no biological family or close family friend is available. Children in foster care benefit when they can stay together and go through adoption as a family unit.</p>

<h3>Communicating With Your Foster Child</h3>

<p>Communication&nbsp;is an essential skill for foster parents. However, building rapport with children who have experienced trauma at the hands of adults can be challenging. Often, foster kids struggle to trust adults.</p>

<p>Establishing trust and opening lines of communication intertwine. The process begins as soon as foster children come into your home. To establish rapport with foster kids, pay genuine attention. If you are open and understanding, a foster child is more likely to feel they can trust you.</p>

<p>Foster kids will be more likely to share their feelings and needs if they feel their foster parent is trustworthy. Statements like, "I know you're adjusting to new things." and "I'm here to talk when you're ready." could go a long way to establishing trust.</p>

<p>Kids who come into foster care have had a rough road with important adults in their lives. Foster children often experience adults telling them what to do without considering their feelings. Foster parents who show they are listening and care are more likely to have foster kids who are open to them.</p>

<p>As your foster relationship grows, regular check-ins throughout the day with your foster kids keep the lines open. Foster families often add foster kids to their phone plan so they can keep in touch during activities away from home.</p>

<h3>How to Set Healthy Structure for Foster Kids</h3>

<p>Foster parent responsibilities include setting and communicating rules&nbsp;and boundaries for your children. Kids often need adult support to establish boundaries. Lots of foster kids come from homes where they haven't had a lot of healthy structure.</p>

<p>Social workers recommend that parents not start with a list of rules as soon as their foster child arrives. Setting too many or too complex rules is a quick way to get off the wrong foot. Discussing home rules and boundaries is best done once the foster child feels comfortable and familiar with their new surroundings.</p>

<p>When setting rules and boundaries, social workers recommend you set the same rules for foster children as for biological children. Rules ought to be easy to understand and follow, with age-appropriate expectations and responsibilities in the home.</p>

<p>Observe your foster child's body language and actions to see if they understand what you say or ask. Every foster child has personal boundaries, though not all will directly answer a question, especially if it makes them uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Creating a home environment that values mutual respect is vital. By showing regard for your foster children's needs and limits, you significantly increase the chances of them respecting yours.</p>

<h3>Safety Basics for Kids in Foster Care</h3>

<p>Children in foster care are vulnerable to abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Foster parents need to be ready for surprises and keep their children safe by discussing safety measures.</p>

<p>Foster families will want to keep emergency contact info accessible for themselves and their children. A quick-access list of services to call for foster care emergencies can reduce stress and get help fast.</p>

<p>Bandages, gauze, and tape are among First-Aid resources to have on hand. These items can save lives if a foster child gets hurt or sick. Your Home Study specialist will help review safety tips and supplies and answer questions about home safety and first aid.</p>

<h3>Setting Up Daily Schedules for Foster Kids</h3>

<p>Kids feel safest when their daily schedule is consistent. The more foster kids feel prepared for the day, the more likely they will feel a confident part of the family.</p>

<p>Ensure you create a daily and weekly schedule with your foster children. Children should be aware of their wake-up time, dinner time, and bedtime routine, including when to switch off the lights.</p>

<p>Kids will also do best when they integrate into their foster family's regular routines. If your family goes to the farmer's market every week, make sure your foster kids know they can come too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How to Support Foster Children</h3>

<p>A foster parent is responsible for ensuring their child has every opportunity to thrive in life. Foster children are, first and foremost, children. They have the same basic needs as any other child. They want to feel loved and secure.</p>

<p>Material needs like food, clothing, toys, and activities are among the items every foster child will need to feel whole. Children grow up, and their needs change quickly. Child welfare advocates train foster parents to prepare for the evolving needs of a foster child.</p>

<p>Foster parents are not alone in supporting their foster children. Foster and adoption agency contacts can help foster parents identify resources, including financial, clothing, and toys. State allowances&nbsp;and&nbsp;charitable donations are among the resources available to help.</p>

<p>Most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fosteruskids.org/usa/all/agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local child-placing agencies</a> stock tangible items most commonly needed by foster kids. As a family in their support network, foster parents have access to these items on their foster child's behalf.</p>

<h3>Finding Counseling or Therapy for Your Foster Child</h3>

<p>Foster children often face a lot of hardships before and after coming into foster care. The child welfare system brings in every foster child because of safety issues at home. No matter the specifics, the displacement can be traumatic in itself, and kids face a new world of uncertainty.</p>

<p>With help from foster parents and social workers in the child welfare system, foster kids have access to counselors and therapists. Specially trained professionals help foster children of all ages with obstacles, loss, change, and any kind of emotional injury they face.</p>

<p>Foster parents must be ready to accompany their foster child to routine therapy or counseling sessions. The state typically provides these services. However, foster parents have the option to select their own therapist or counselor who agrees to use the state's insurance.</p>

<p>Numerous kinds of therapy and counseling services are accessible for children in foster care. Trauma counseling for PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and other&nbsp;mental health issues&nbsp;are the most prevalent. The standard approach to addressing PTSD involves extended therapy, with weekly sessions lasting anywhere from one to three hours. Foster children facing behavioral or social challenges often receive counseling as a common form of treatment.</p>

<p>Counseling is a typical therapy for foster children struggling with behavioral problems or social issues. This kind of counseling process helps foster kids better understand the often conflicting or confusing emotions they feel. Counselors help foster children find ways to manage strong emotions in positive ways. The goal is to find ways to cope without getting into trouble in their social groups or with authority figures.</p>

<p>What makes a good therapist for foster children? Foster parents will want a credentialed professional who is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Empathetic and understanding</li>
	<li>Patient</li>
	<li>Willing to put in the long-term relationship work</li>
	<li>Capable and experienced in helping with challenging issues</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Importance of School and Academic Life</h3>

<p>Schools are important for foster children. Schools create community among families and kids. They also provide structure and teach kids useful skills for successful futures as students and self-sufficient adults.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upheavals in the personal lives of foster kids often cause absences or changes in schools. This or prior challenges could cause them to fall behind academically. They may need extra support to catch up, as well as a patient caregiver to help navigate a new school system.</p>

<p>Be prepared to find&nbsp;tutoring or help your foster child catch up in school.&nbsp;Foster kids have likely had to move schools at least once and may have fallen behind academically. Some foster kids struggle with learning disabilities, such as ADHD or autism. They may need special education services or a tailored program known as an Individual Educational Plan (IEP).</p>

<p>Foster kids might face challenges fitting in at a new school, especially if others label them as "the new kid." This could make them a target of harassment and bullying, further harming their confidence.</p>

<p>Foster kids facing these challenges away from home do not always feel comfortable telling an adult. As a foster parent, it is important to maintain communication with teachers or school staff. This allows for prompt resolution of any issues that may arise.</p>

<p>Foster parents will be the primary responsible adult to help foster kids of any age integrate into their new school. It may be helpful for foster kids to join school sports and activities. Foster parents can also help by arranging playdates or hangouts with new friends from the child's school or community.</p>

<p>It is important to provide children with a&nbsp;safe, structured environment&nbsp;where they can learn and grow. In-school and after-school programs create opportunities for kids to make friends, learn new things, and build confidence.</p>

<h3>Creating Fun Experiences With Your Foster Kids</h3>

<p>Parents often feel busy managing the responsibilities of raising a child. Foster parents must give stability, consistency, and care to their foster kids, even as they get to know them.</p>

<p>Taking time off from the routine can be tricky. However, having fun with your foster kids is as important as providing for their primary care needs. People of all ages benefit from free time, downtime, and playtime!</p>

<p>There are many ways to have fun with foster kids without disrupting their schedules. Any planned or spontaneous break from the usual daily routine can be fun.</p>

<p>Ask what activities your foster child would enjoy. You and your foster child could plan a day trip, play at a park, or enjoy a festival. You could visit a museum or local attraction. You can always find a game, go to the movies, or make your own mini-adventure.</p>

<p>Children benefit from participating in activities outside their homes and school. These activities help them socialize, form bonds with their family, and simply laugh.</p>

<p>What are Issues That Concern Foster Parents?</p>

<p>Many foster parents face unprepared challenges, such as behavioral and social problems or manipulative behaviors.</p>

<p>Foster parenting is a learned skill that takes time and practice. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Resources and educational opportunities are available to supplement foster parent training. Some challenges and surprises are avoidable by better understanding a foster child's background.</p>

<p>Some therapists use evaluation tools like Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) ratings&nbsp;to evaluate and understand the extent of childhood trauma. These findings help identify, communicate, and treat issues causing a child to struggle.</p>

<p>Some situations raise bigger challenges for foster families and require professional support. Your agency will help train you as a foster parent and provide you with community resources. Your caseworker will also assist in finding counseling or therapy for your foster child.</p>

<h3>How to Manage Discipline Issues</h3>

<p>Even though you establish&nbsp;clear rules and boundaries with your foster children, they may break through the boundaries at some point. Pushing boundaries is a natural part of growing up.</p>

<p>Many children in foster care will experience triggers from past physical or emotional punishment. Some people consider certain forms of punishment to be child abuse. Physical discipline is never acceptable for a foster child.</p>

<p>Instead, social workers train foster parents to follow logical consequences for broken rules. For example, if a child watches TV when not allowed, perhaps they will lose television privileges for a week. Your initial pre-service training and ongoing foster training will teach you how to establish boundaries and discipline if necessary.</p>

<h3>Understanding Anger Issues in Foster Children</h3>

<p>Many children enter the foster care system dealing with feelings of anger from the emotional distress or physical trauma they've experienced. Many suffer with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder&nbsp;(PDSD)&nbsp;from prior abuse or neglect. Some kids may have been in the foster care system for years and have difficulty dealing with frequent home changes. Without the stability of a supportive adult and a home base, foster kids may feel displaced, lost, and out of control.</p>

<p>Often, anger is one of the root causes of destructive behavior in foster children. While many factors contribute to anger in kids, there is no single solution for it.</p>

<p>For example, a foster child may lash out in anger, feeling they don't belong. This behavior is their way of fighting back against the welfare system. Others might snap because they feel ignored or left out. Some kids misbehave because they feel stressed or powerless, with stressors stemming from before or after foster care began.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foster parents are often able to address anger issues themselves. However, in some cases, help from a therapist or counselor is most beneficial.&nbsp;When dealing with anger in foster children, be sure to approach with a calm, level-headed, and open demeanor. These strategies will help a child to calm down and talk more openly about their feelings.</p>

<h3>How to Help Foster Children Cope with Trauma</h3>

<p>Foster children have often experienced abuse of some type, such as physical, emotional, sexual abuse, or neglect. Depending upon individual circumstances, a child's brain development may be unable to process the mental anguish or physical injury they've experienced.</p>

<p>An abused child will often have difficulty trusting others because adults have harmed them in the past. They might also struggle with self-esteem and develop negative behaviors such as substance use or self-harm. Building a trusting relationship with your foster child and being an adult they can consistently count on is vitally important.</p>

<p>Foster children are also at greater risk of abuse while they are in foster care. As a foster parent, it is important to understand signs of abuse, especially while you're getting to know foster children.</p>

In foster parent training, you'll learn to spot and report abuse signs and handle the after-effects impacting your foster child. Understanding&nbsp;how to navigate a mental health crisis&nbsp;is essential for all parents. Your caseworker or other foster child advocates at your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fosteruskids.org/usa/all/agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">child-placing agency</a> are there to help.</p>

<h3>Runaways and Foster Care</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, even the best foster care parents sometimes face&nbsp;<a href="https://advocacyinaction.casaforchildren.org/permanency/youth-who-run-away-from-foster-care/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a runaway child.</a></p>

<p>For many reasons, foster children might run away from their foster homes. Some foster children may feel that their foster parents or other family members do not understand or support them. They may also feel scared because of a negative experience in a previous foster home or family.</p>

<p>Some foster children worry that no one will love or adopt them. Others fear losing their identity or simply feel uneasy in their new home.</p>

<p>Running away can have serious consequences for foster children, especially if they live on the streets without support or guidance. Social workers may remove individuals who have previously run away from their foster home and place them into a group home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best strategy to prevent a foster child from running away is to ensure a safe home environment and provide care. Foster families must closely monitor new foster children for signs of wanting to run away. These signs are not always easy to spot.</p>

<p>Foster children need a robust&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/therapy-adoption-child-behavior/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">system of support</a>&nbsp;for themselves and their families. They are unlikely to run away if they feel supported and safe at home. Parents or guardians must educate kids about the risks they face when they run away. Adults need to explain the risks and consequences stemming from running away, even if it's only for a short period.</p>

<h3>How to Help Foster Children Deal With Social Issues</h3>

<p>Kids in foster care may have social problems if they lack stability or struggle to make emotional bonds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for foster kids to have difficulty adjusting to their new surroundings and making friends. New surroundings can create social challenges for even the most well-adjusted kid.</p>

<p>Harassment, bullying, and cyberbullying pose a greater risk to foster children. This can exacerbate social awkwardness or exclusion, leading to unhealthy behaviors and choices. One result may be digital or social media addictions&nbsp;that can negatively impact a child's mental health.</p>

<p>As foster children age, they may also experience social awkwardness because they do not fit in with their peers. Foster parents need to be aware of these social issues to support their children through challenging adjustments. Foster parents' love and support are vital for foster kids to grow into happy, healthy individuals. Foster parents must give time to be emotionally available and ready to guide their foster children into positive social situations.</p>

<h3>Aging Out of the Foster Care System</h3>

<p>In an ideal world, a loving foster family adopts every foster kid who cannot return to their biological family. Unfortunately, not every foster child finds a family. Many kids stay in the foster care system until they become legal adults and are on their own.</p>

<p>Many states have a program for when foster kids "age out." Depending on the state, foster kids must leave foster care when they turn 18 to 21 years old. Some states have programs to assist kids who meet certain requirements with transitioning into independence.</p>

<p>Foster kids who "age out" do not necessarily need to move out of their foster homes. However, the state considers them to be out of foster care and removes their child welfare support system.</p>

<p>Many foster kids struggle with trauma before and during their time in the foster care system. Foster kids have a harder time when they leave foster care without the skills or means to take care of themselves. Statistics show that foster kids have worse outcomes in life after foster care ends.</p>

<h3>What Happens After Teens Age Out of Foster Care</h3>

<p>The foster care system provides a temporary home for children. It does not provide indefinite support. The goal of most foster cases is reunification, or rejoining kids with their biological family following time in foster care. When returning home is not possible, foster agencies seek to place foster children into adoptive homes, sometimes with their foster families.</p>

<p>After aging out of care, adolescents often struggle to find a stable home and support system. Many lack reliable adult role models to teach them life skills or support them during their transition. Around 4,000 kids leave foster care each year and end up homeless, staying in shelters or transitional housing. These same kids are significantly less likely to graduate from high school or have positive outcomes in their futures.</p>

<p>Once a foster kid turns 18 years old, they become a legal adult in the United States. As an adult, they are&nbsp;no longer eligible&nbsp;for benefits from the system and must fend for themselves. Over 20% of children who age out of foster care become homeless immediately.&nbsp;This is a staggering statistic to comprehend, but the hardship often compounds from there.</p>

<p>Many foster kids who have reached adulthood face various challenges stacked upon homelessness. These include drug addiction, pregnancy, STDs, domestic violence, and other destructive issues.</p>

<h3>Laying Foster Foundations for Success</h3>

<p>Support for former foster children is critical as they age out of the system. Many former foster children need help transitioning into adulthood and finding their place in society.</p>

<p>As a foster parent, there are steps you can take to help your foster children be successful after aging out. Encouraging them to finish their education is paramount. Many foster children drop out of high school, but a high school diploma is their gateway to better jobs and opportunities.</p>

<p>Allow foster youth to explore career opportunities while still under your care. Give them support and guide them to resources for pursuing these opportunities after they leave the child welfare system. You can also support them in finding a trade or career they are interested in studying beyond high school.</p>

<p>Foster parents must teach foster kids financial responsibility and provide the tools they need after they leave foster care. Many kids growing up in their biological homes struggle with finances in new young adulthood. Limited family support adds to the challenges faced by foster kids, leading many to struggle in life after leaving the system.</p>

<p>Foster parents can put in place some of the financial framework young people need. This includes setting foster youth up with a bank account and debit card of their own. Helping teens obtain and maintain a part-time job during high school teaches them valuable financial and time management skills. Additionally, it provides them with a sense of financial independence.</p>

<p>There are many other ways responsible foster parents can support their newly minted adult foster kids. For example, many foster parents help their former foster children look for an apartment and buy a car.</p>

<p>One way to make a significant difference in a former foster kid's life is by helping to cover their education expenses. Supporting their education, whether through trade school, community college, or university, can change their lives and lead to success.</p>

<h3>How to Support Youth After Foster Care</h3>

<p>Foster children&nbsp;"age out"&nbsp;of the system when they turn 18 years old or 21 years in some states. When they transition into independent adulthood, they no longer have the support of social services they had while in foster care. Different transition supports are available in some states; however, it is up to the individual to seek them out. Often, foster kids who have aged out of care feel overwhelmed or, for other reasons, feel opposed to getting help.</p>

<p>Aging-out programs vary from state to state. Many states offer a program to help this vulnerable population get on their feet. There are also a multitude of private non-profits that help with housing, employment, and other adult responsibilities.</p>

<p>For those who had foster care counseling, continued therapeutic support is available for young adults. However, a barrier exists because often it isn't readily available or free.</p>

<h3>Staying Connected After Kids Leave Foster Care</h3>

<p>Foster parents make a positive impact on the lives of foster children. These adults can continue to be a force for good in the lives of former foster kids who didn't get adopted. Tell your former foster kids they can always count on you for support, even after they leave your home. Stay connected and continue to be an adult role model.</p>

<p>Some foster parents can't provide financial support, but emotional support is equally valuable for young adults. Being a trusted friend and guide for foster kids can greatly impact their lives.</p>

<p>Foster parents can maintain an open-door policy with their former foster kids, as many do with their biological family members. Adults can stay connected with their foster kids into adulthood through family dinners, holidays, and financial support.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Adoption as an Option</h3>

<p>Adoption is the legal process in which an adult assumes full parental responsibility for a child. This includes all the rights, duties, and enjoyment that come from becoming a family.</p>

<p>Some foster parents intend to maintain their foster parent status for short-term foster care. However, many others hope to adopt their foster children.</p>

<p>Families adopt approximately 70% of foster children. In fact, the potential of adopting a child is why many adults become foster parents in the first place!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Foster-to-Adopt</h3>

<p>Adults interested in "foster to adopt" can mention it on their foster parent application or inform their<a href="https://www.fosteruskids.org/usa/all/agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> local child-placing agency</a>. From the outset, foster-to-adopt parents actively enter the selection process for children available for adoption.</p>

<p>It is imperative to remember that&nbsp;fostering is not an expensive and easy way to adopt a baby. Agencies reject many people who want to "Foster to Adopt" if they only want infants. Many rejections happen because there are not enough babies and young children in foster care to fulfill requests for them.</p>

<p>Foster parents open to adopting any age children will have a quicker foster-to-adopt process. Thousands of amazing kids in foster systems across the country would love to be part of your family and home.</p>

<p>Another thing you should consider is that&nbsp;foster care's primary goal&nbsp;is to reunify children with their biological families. Foster parents must prepare themselves for the possibility that the foster kids placed in their care may go home any day.</p>

<p>It's easy to grow close to your foster child and feel sad when they go back to their biological family. While this can feel devastating, it is best to remember the child's welfare. In most cases, it is in the foster child's best interest to return to their home.</p>

<h3>Direct Adoption Pathway</h3>

<p>Another option for adopting foster children is to adopt them directly. State agencies actively connect families interested in adoption with foster children eligible for adoption.</p>

<p>Like becoming a foster parent, you will still need to undergo an application to adopt foster children directly. Direct adoption is very similar to the process of taking a foster placement.</p>

<p>Some foster children do not want to be adopted. Reasons vary, but they could have had too much family trauma or are functionally independent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adults choosing to adopt from foster care will have meetings only with children who are seeking adoption. These kids will be over the moon to be part of a forever family.</p>

<p>When you complete an adoption application, you can specify preferences like age range, gender, race, and care needed.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fosteruskids.org/usa/all/agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">State agencies</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;child-placing agencies&nbsp;will match your preferences with children who are eligible for adoption.</p>

<p>Prospective adoptive parents meet with children, often over many visits. This allows everyone to start getting to know each other and see if the match feels like a good fit.</p>

<p>After deciding to pursue adoption, there is a lengthy process for filing paperwork and legal documents. But in the end, your new family will be ready to begin a new life together!</p>

<h3>Adoptive Parent Support Resources</h3>

<p>Adopting foster children is a rewarding and life-changing experience, though it can be hard to go at it alone.</p>

<p>Specialized resources are available for parents of adopted foster children to support and ensure the new family succeeds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some states have implemented a post-adoption support program for adoptive families. This program helps the adoptive parents by providing one-on-one counseling and social groups.</p>

<p>Parents can connect with other adoptive parents through support groups or counseling sessions.</p>

<h3>Adopting Older Children and Teens</h3>

<p>There is a lot of misconception about the benefits of&nbsp;adopting older children&nbsp;and teenagers. Many believe it is not worth the risk or simply too much of a challenge. Adolescents in foster care represent the largest need for foster and adoptive homes. There are many rewards for&nbsp;adopting older children and teenagers.</p>

<p>Teens generally have less trouble adjusting to their new family than younger kids would. They already know what it's like to be away from their biological parents and in need of help.</p>

<p>Some consider adoption an investment in a child's future. Adopting an older child can greatly improve their quality of life compared to "aging out" of the foster system as adults. Adopted teenagers and older children often have better social skills and academic performances by the time they reach adulthood.&nbsp;Adoption also boosts self-esteem and self-confidence in foster youth who have experienced abuse or neglect.</p>

<p>Adopting a child solidifies the feeling of belonging, value, and stability for children of all ages. These are particularly strange and welcome feelings among teenagers who have had a rough start in life.</p>

<h3>Foster Care Statistics</h3>

<p>On any given day in the United States, there are&nbsp;around <a href="https://www.clccal.org/resources/foster-care-facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">437,000 children in foster care</a>.</p>

<p>It may come as a surprise to some, but not every foster child is available for adoption. The ultimate goal of foster care is to reunite children with their biological families. However, this is not always possible.</p>

<p>Some states have a high rate of foster-to-adoption. Foster families adopt 70% of Virginia foster children, as an example. Not all this country's foster kids are so lucky.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, foster care also nationally has some devastating statistics. Over 20,000 children age out of foster care every year without finding a permanent home. Foster youth have higher school dropout rates, abuse and trauma, and more difficulties in their adult lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An excellent foster care experience is vital for foster youth to thrive and reach their full potential. With caring foster parents, these children can flourish and succeed on par with their peers outside the foster care system.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Changing the Life of a Child Through Foster Care</h3>

<p>We all wish the foster care system wasn't necessary in our society, but it is. All kids need a loving home, but there aren't enough of these homes for all foster children. Foster kids who find a good foster family have a life-changing source of love and comfort.</p>
